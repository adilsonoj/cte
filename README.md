## How it works?

We use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) App for Android.

## Getting Started

1. Install [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/libraries#installing-a-library), if you don't have it yet.

2. Now clone this repository:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/adilsonoj/cte.git
    ```

3. Then go to the project's folder:

    ```sh
    $ cd cte
    ```

4. Install all dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

5. Generate a [new app firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and insert the ```google-services.json``` in /android/app.

6. And finally run:

    ```sh
    $ npm run android
    ```
